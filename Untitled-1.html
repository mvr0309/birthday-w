    <h1>HAPPY BIRTHDAY KANI!!!</h1>

    <p>Dear Kaniemozhi (a name as sweet as the person who owns it),</p>
    
    <p>There are a few moments I cherish the most in my life, and meeting you for the first time in 14 years is undoubtedly one of them. You know, with some people, it feels like you've known them for ages, and you regret all those times you didn't spend together. That's exactly how you make me feel. I believe the celestial bodies conspired to bring our paths together again because they foresaw what an incredible duo we would make! You're so much fun to be with, and you make me feel completely at ease expressing myself around you. Individuals like you are truly rare gems, but you're the kind that makes this world a better place. Keep that wonderful smile going so I can keep telling you, 'Unge smile cute ah iruke,' which is absolutely true, by the way! 🌸 I'm not sure what life has in store for us, but I definitely don't want to lose your presence in it. Thank you for accepting me as your friend and for indulging me in my silly talks. I'm genuinely sorry for forgetting your birthday—a mistake I promise not to repeat. </p>

    <p> Once again HAPPY BIRTHDAY and cheers to another amazing year ahead!🎉</p>

    <p> LOVE AND LOVE ONLY,
        🌸 🌷 🌹 🌻 🌼 🌺 Mathi ❤️🧡💛💚💙 💜 🖤 🤍
    </p>

    <p> P.S: Here are three songs that I would like to dedicate to you. One song which reminds me of you, one because you like poetry and the other, i guess it sounds perfect for us</p>
